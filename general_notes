# Steps:
# - make sure target genotype data is in vcf.gz file format
# - predixcan step1 - impute GREX 
# - predixcan step2 - test for association GREX-phenotype

# generate scripts (plink) to convert formats if needed
# this is chrom-by-chrom
# fam_file: if there is a particular subset of people in target data that you want to keep (not needed if using everyone)
